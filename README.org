* Installation and setup
In your config file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/bart-mode")
  (require 'bart-mode)
#+END_SRC
The default station can be set with ~bart-station~ which must be set to a recognized station abbreviation.
For example, to set your default station to civic center:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bart-station 'civc)
#+END_SRC
The complete list of abbreviations can be viewed by using =M-x describe-variable= on =bart-stations=

By default the bart buffer is displayed with ~display-buffer~. The option ~bart-manage-window~
can be used to display the bart window similar to how the calc window is displayed. This is disabled by default, to enable:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bart-manage-window t)
#+END_SRC

These options, and others, may also be set with =M-x customize-group= and selecting the =bart= group

* Usage
To view real time bart departures:
: M-x bart

supported key commands:
| s | select another station      |
